<h1>NoMut</h1>
<p>
The NoMut contains a couple of mutators that will allow you to alter the content of levels as you see fit. <br />
You will be able to either remove items completely or to replace one item with the other.<br />
<b>Note:</b> changing content of levels has an impact on the game play. Thus using these mutators won't make your server show up as a <i>standard server</i><br />
</p>
<p>
This package contains the following mutators:
<ul>
	<li><a href="#mutNoMut">NoMut</a><br />
	Removes items from a level.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#mutNoMutPerMap">NoMut per Map</a><br />Per map configuration</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="#mutReMut">ReMut</a><br />
	Replaces items in a level.

<h2>Revision history</h2>
<h3>Changes since v100</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pickup bases, weapon lockers and vehicles factories will now be checked and updated/removed when needed. This will have a more polished result.</li>
</ul>

<a name="mutNoMut"></a>
<h2>NoMut</h2>
This mutator can remove certain elements from the level. You can remove things like pickups, vehicles, pretty much everything. <br />
<i>Technical:</i> every <code>Actor</code> with properties <code>bNoDelete=false</code> and <code>bStatic=false</code> can be removed from the game.

<h3>Installation</h3>
The mutator name is:<br />
<code>NoMut.mutNoMut</code><br />
You can install it as any other mutator. When installed and configured correctly it will add a new field to the server info list:<br />
<code>NoMut Removes: ...</code><br />
This contains a list actors that are removed from the game.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
The configuration of this mutator goes into the system configuration file (<code>UT2004.ini</code>):
<pre>
[NoMut.mutNoMut]
bLog=false
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false,bSafeCheck=false,Exempt=("<i>Package.Class</i>","<i>Package.Class</i>"))
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false,bSafeCheck=false)
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false)
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>")
...
</pre>
<dl>
	<dt>bLog</dt>
	<dd>If set to true it will log the items removed from the game. This is a debug setting and is not recuired to be enabled.</dd>
	<dt>No</dt>
	<dd>This is a list with classes to be removed. Virtually you can ad as much entries as you want. Only ClassName is required.
	<dl>
		<dt>ClassName</dt>
		<dd>This is the fully qualified name of the class to be removed, for example the fully qualified name of Assault rifle is: <code>xWeapons.AssaultRiflePickup</code>. If the ClassName is invalid it will be reported in the log.<br />You can use tools like <a href="http://uncodex.elmuerte.com">UnCodeX</a>, or it's <a href="http://unreal.student.utwente.nl/uncodex-ut2004/">output</a> to find the full class names.</dd>
		<dt>bRecurse</dt>
		<dd>If this is set to true all subclasses of the specified classname will also be removed from this game. For example if the ClassName is <code>Engine.Vehicle</code> it will remove all vehicles from the game. False by default</dd>
		<dt>bSafeCheck</dt>
		<dd>Only remove actors if it's not vital for the game. The checks performed are listed below. Defaults to false.</dd>
		<dt>Exempt</dt>
		<dd>Exempt these classes from being replaced. This is only used when <code>bRecurse=true</code>. These subclasses will be left alone, this is also recursive.</dd>

<a name="mutNoMutPerMap"></a>
<h2>NoMut per Map</h2>
This mutator does the name as <a href="#mutNoMut">NoMut</a> but it has a per map configuration. This will allow you to use different rules for each map.

<h3>Installation</h3>
The mutator name is:<br />
<code>NoMut.mutNoMutPerMap</code>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
The configuration is pretty much identical to the on of NoMut. The <code>No=</code> configuration is the default configuration if the current map doesn't have it's own configuration.
<pre>
[NoMut.mutNoMutPerMap]
bLog=false
bAutoCreateConfig=false
ConfigClassName=NoMut.NoMutConfig
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false,bSafeCheck=false,Exempt=("<i>Package.Class</i>","<i>Package.Class</i>"))
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false,bSafeCheck=false)
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false)
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>")
...
</pre>
<dl>
	<dt>bAutoCreateConfig</dt>
	<dd>If set to true a configuration entry is created for the map if it didn't have one already.</dd>
	<dt>ConfigClassName</dt>
	<dd>This defines the configuration class used to store the per map configuration. See below for more info</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Per map configuration</h4>
Each map will have it's own section in the configuration file (depends on the <code>ConfigClassName</code>). Each section will look like this:
<pre>
[<i>MapName</i> <i>ConfigClass</i>]
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false,bSafeCheck=false,Exempt=("<i>Package.Class</i>","<i>Package.Class</i>"))
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false,bSafeCheck=false)
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>",bRecurse=false)
No=(ClassName="<i>Package.Class</i>")
...
</pre>

<dl>
	<dt>MapName</dt>
	<dd>This is the name of the map, it's just filename without the extention. It's not case sensitive.</dd>
	<dt>ConfigClass</dt>
	<dd>The name of the config class used, it's one of the following: <code>NoMutConfig</code>, <code>NoMutConfigGlobal</code>, <code>NoMutConfigMap</code></dd>
	<dt>No</dt>
	<dd>This configuration is identical to the mutator configuration.</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Configuration classes</h5>
<dl>
	<dt>NoMut.NoMutConfig</dt>
	<dd>This is the default configuration class, it will store the per map configuration in the system configuration file (<code>UT2004.ini</code>). The <i>ConfigClass</i> name to use in the map configuration section is: <code>NoMutConfig</code></dd>
	<dt>NoMut.NoMutConfigGlobal</dt>
	<dd>This will store the configuration per map in a global configuration file <code>NoMutConfig.ini</code>, this is usefull to share the complete configuration between servers. The <i>ConfigClass</i> name to use in the map configuration section is: <code>NoMutConfigGlobal</code></dd>
	<dt>NoMut.NoMutConfigMap</dt>
	<dd>This will store the configuration in a seperate file for each map: <code><i>MapName</i>.ini</code>. The <i>ConfigClass</i> name to use in the map configuration section is: <code>NoMutConfigMap</code></dd>
</dl>

<a name="mutReMut"></a>
<h2>ReMut</h2>
This mutator can replace certain elements in the level. You can replace things pretty much anything for anything else, e.g. replace a vehicle for a weapon. 
This mutator is pretty much identical to the Arena mutators, except this gives you a more advanced method to configure.<br />
<i>Technical:</i> every <code>Actor</code> with properties <code>bNoDelete=false</code> and <code>bStatic=false</code> can be replaced.

<h3>Installation</h3>
The mutator name is:<br />
<code>NoMut.mutReMut</code><br />
You can install it as any other mutator. When installed and configured correctly it will add a new field to the server info list:<br />
<code>ReMut Replaces: ...</code><br />
This contains a list actors that are replaced.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
The configuration of this mutator goes into the system configuration file (<code>UT2004.ini</code>):

<a name="mutReMutPerMap"></a>
<h2>ReMut per Map</h2>
This mutator is just like the <a href="#mutNoMutPerMap">NoMut per Map mutator</a> a per map configuration of ReMut. <br />
The mutator works the same as the NoMut version, the only difference is the class names used for the ConfigClassName variable. <br />
<table>
</tr>
	<th>NoMut per Map class</th><th>ReMut per Map class</th>
</tr>
<tr><td><code>NoMut.NoMutConfig</code></td><td><code>NoMut.ReMutConfig</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NoMut.NoMutConfigGlobal</code></td><td><code>NoMut.ReMutConfigGlobal</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NoMut.NoMutConfigMap</code></td><td><code>NoMut.ReMutConfigMap</code></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Appendix</h2>
<h3>Safe Check</h3>
The following checks are performed to check if a actor is safe to be replaced\removed.
<dl>
	<dt>Vehicle classes</dt>
	<dd><code>bKeyVehicle</code> variable is set to false. By default only the <code>ONSMobileAssaultStation</code> and <code>ONSHoverTank_IonPlasma</code> have these set.</dd>
	<dt>Weapon classes</dt>
	<dd><code>bCanThrow</code> variable is set to true. Weapons you can not throw are usualy important for the game (like the ball launcher)</dd>
	<dt>Controller classes</dt>
	<dd>In case of Team Games the result of the function <code>CriticalPlayer</code> defines the safe state. This is game type depended, usualy you don't replace\remove controller classes</dd>
